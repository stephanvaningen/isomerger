This litle package is created in order to automatically extract a Red Hat ISO to a folder, merge folders, shell files, kickstart files, ... in it, have it change some data in isolinux/isolinux.cfg / efi/boot/grub.cfg & then write it back to a .iso

Last step is to automatically create a usb startup stick.
